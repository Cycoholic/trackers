    <h1>Traccar testing</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>Install "Traccar Client" app.<br><br>
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.traccar.client">Click here for Android</a><br><br>
          <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/traccar-client/id843156974">Click here for iOS</a><br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Open app. Set the following settings:
        <ul>
          <li>Server Url: <span class="setting">http://trackrace.tk:5055</span> (<b>Important. You must change this!</b>)</li>
          <li>Frequency: Choose as you desire. Recommended: <span class="setting">300</span> = 5min</li>
          <li>Distance/Angle: <span class="setting">&nbsp;</span> (Leave blank) (Default)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Make sure your gps is not disabled on your phone.</li>
      <li>Start service</li>
      <li>Note Device identifier</li>
      <li>Check the tracker is working in a browser. Go to <span class="setting">https://trackrace.tk/traccar/[DEVICE IDENTIFIER]</span></li>
      <li>Go for ride</li>
      <li>Stop service</li>
      <li>Let Gary know how it went :-)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The tracking page will show tracking for the last 7 days.</li>
      <li>Any one who knows your device identifier will be able view the tracking data. It will be difficult for
        someone to guess this, but not impossible. So make sure the traccar service is off if you are going some where
        that don't want other people to know about. If you want me to delete some traking data, just send me a message.</li>
    </ul>
